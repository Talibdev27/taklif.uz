# Wedding Platform Security Implementation

## Critical Security Issue Fixed: Data Isolation

### Problem
Previously, users could access all weddings in the system regardless of ownership, violating data privacy and creating a critical security vulnerability.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Authentication Middleware
- `authenticateToken`: Verifies JWT tokens for all protected routes
- `verifyWeddingOwnership`: Ensures users can only access their own weddings
- `requireAdmin`: Restricts admin-only endpoints to authorized administrators

#### 2. Secure Route Implementation

**User Routes (Data Isolation Enforced):**
- `GET /api/user/weddings` - Returns only user's own weddings
- `GET /api/weddings/:id` - Wedding access with ownership verification
- `PUT /api/weddings/:id` - Wedding updates with ownership verification
- `DELETE /api/weddings/:id` - Wedding deletion with ownership verification
- `GET /api/weddings/:id/guests` - Guest access with wedding ownership verification
- `POST /api/weddings/:id/guests` - Guest creation with wedding ownership verification
- `GET /api/weddings/:id/photos` - Photo access with wedding ownership verification
- `POST /api/weddings/:id/photos` - Photo upload with wedding ownership verification

**Admin Routes (Full Access):**
- All `/api/admin/*` endpoints require admin authentication
- Admin users can access all system data for management purposes

**Guest Manager Routes:**
- `GET /api/guest-manager/weddings` - Restricted to guest_manager role users
- Guest managers can only access their own assigned weddings

#### 3. Security Verification

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Unauthenticated requests properly rejected (HTTP 401)
- ✅ Non-admin users cannot access admin endpoints (HTTP 403)
- ✅ Users can only see their own wedding data
- ✅ Admin users have full system access
- ✅ Wedding ownership verification prevents cross-user access

#### 4. Implementation Details

**Ownership Verification Logic:**
```javascript
// Check if user owns the wedding or is admin
if (!isAdmin && wedding.userId !== userId) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Unauthorized access to this wedding' });
}
```

**Data Isolation Pattern:**
- User routes filter by `userId` from authenticated token
- Admin routes bypass filters but require admin privileges
- Wedding-specific routes verify ownership through middleware

#### 5. Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Authentication Required**: All sensitive endpoints require valid JWT tokens
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels for users, guest managers, and admins
3. **Ownership Verification**: Users can only access their own data
4. **Admin Override**: Administrators can access all data for management purposes
5. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
6. **Token Validation**: JWT tokens verified on every protected request

#### 6. Endpoints Secured

**Before (Vulnerable):**
- Users could access any wedding by ID
- No ownership verification
- Admin endpoints unprotected

**After (Secure):**
- All wedding access requires ownership verification
- User-specific data filtering implemented
- Admin endpoints protected with proper authentication
- Role-based access control enforced

#### 7. Database Security

The implementation ensures:
- No direct database queries expose other users' data
- All queries filter by authenticated user ID
- Admin queries clearly separated and protected
- No data leakage between user accounts

### Conclusion

The security implementation successfully addresses the critical data isolation issue while maintaining proper functionality for different user roles. Users can now only access their own wedding data, while administrators retain the ability to manage the entire system.
